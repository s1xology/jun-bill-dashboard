# Apple Shortcuts for Expense Tracking

## Features

This shortcut provides convenient expense tracking directly on your iPhone with the following capabilities:
- **Smart Amount Detection**: When expense information (amounts) appears on your phone screen, the shortcut can capture screenshots and automatically extract the monetary values
- **Automatic Time Recording**: Records the current timestamp when logging each expense
- **Category Selection**: Provides a predefined list for easy category selection (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Rent, etc.)
- **Optional Notes**: Includes an input dialog box where you can add additional notes or descriptions for each expense entry

These features perfectly correspond to the four columns of structured data you'll ultimately collect: Date, Amount, Category, and Description.
