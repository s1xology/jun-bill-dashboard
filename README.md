This project automates expense tracking through a complete data pipeline using Apple Shortcuts, AppleScript, Google Apps Script, and Google Looker Studio. The system creates an end-to-end workflow from data collection to visualization, streamlining the entire process of exporting expense data, processing it, and presenting it in an interactive dashboard with minimal manual intervention.

## Why I Built This

This project began as a spontaneous idea while I was studying in the US. I've always had the habit of tracking my expenses, and my girlfriend and I often discuss financial planning and budgeting together. Since I'm majoring in Business Analytics, I thought: "Why not build a dashboard to visualize exactly where my money goes?" It's a perfect opportunity to apply my technical skills to real-world financial management!

## Components

1. **`Apple Shortcuts`**: Provides convenient expense tracking on iPhone, allowing quick data entry and automatic categorization through iOS automation workflows.

2. **`AppleScript`**: Automates the export of expense data from Numbers to CSV format and uploads to Google Drive. Includes error handling, logging functionality, and manages the complete export workflow from opening the document to saving the output file. Features duplicate prevention logic that tracks the last export date to avoid multiple executions on the same day.

3. **`LaunchAgent`**: Enables the AppleScript to run automatically on a daily schedule without manual intervention. Uses macOS LaunchAgent to trigger the export process at specific times (17:30, 21:00, 22:00) each day, ensuring consistent data synchronization.

4. **`Google Apps Script`**: Automatically processes and transforms CSV data from Google Drive into structured Google Sheets. Implements category mapping logic to create aggregated expense categories, dynamically inserts calculated columns, and maintains dual sheet layouts with different header configurations for flexible data analysis.

5. **`Google Looker Studio`**: Visualizes the processed data in a dashboard format. Includes documentation of calculated fields creation process. The `dashboard link` is provided at the top and in the Live Dashboard section for your convenience.

6. **`Sample Logs`**: Contains sample output files that demonstrate the project's functionality and serve as examples of the automated system's output. Includes `jun-bill-dashboard.log` showing execution history with timestamps (successful exports and skipped runs based on scheduling logic), and `jun-bill-last-export-date.txt` tracking the most recent export date to prevent duplicate processing.

## Data Pipeline & Usage Workflow

The system operates through a complete automated data pipeline with the following workflow and refresh frequencies:


```
                    iCloud           Google Drive          Google Drive           Google Drive

          Extract              Load              Transform             Visualization
Raw Data   ----->   Numbers   ----->   CSV File   ----->   Google Sheets  ----->  Looker Studio
          (Apple           (AppleScript+          (Google                          (Dashboard)
         Shortcuts)         LaunchAgent)        Apps Script)

         Real-time          17:30-22:00           2:00 AM               Every 15 min
                           (Once per day)          Daily                   Refresh
```

1. **Data Collection**: Use Apple Shortcuts to track expenses on your iOS device
    - *Real-time - Multiple entries per day as expenses occur*

2. **Data Export**: The plist configuration triggers AppleScript to automatically export data from Numbers to CSV and upload to Google Drive
    - *Triggered 3 times daily (17:30, 21:00, 22:00), but executes maximum once per day*

3. **Data Processing**: Google Apps Script automatically processes the CSV data into structured Google Sheets
    - *Once per day at 02:00 AM via Google Apps Script trigger*

4. **Data Visualization**: Access the Google Looker Studio dashboard to visualize and analyze the expenses
    - *Dashboard refreshes every 15 minutes, new data appears once per day around 02:15 AM*

## **Live Dashboard**

**[View Live Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/6f470c98-84ab-4fd8-844c-f397e2b9bd34)** - Click to access the full interactive dashboard with live data filtering capabilities.

> **Note**: Due to certain limitations (mobile compatibility, browser restrictions, report sizing issues, etc.), bar charts and pie charts may not display properly on mobile devices. However, they work perfectly on desktop and tablet devices.

> **Manual Timestamp Limitation**: Manually added records only include the date (year-month-day), whereas Shortcut-automated entries capture the full timestamp (year-month-day hour:minute:second); as a result, records within the same day may not reflect their true chronological order in the dashboard. This is a trade-off between data collection convenience and analytical precision.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure each component according to your environment (file paths, Google Drive folders IDs, etc.).
3. Set up the automation schedule using the provided plist file.
4. Adjust the code based on your personal data recording habits and visualization requirements.
5. Test each component to ensure proper functionality.

> **Note**: All code files have been privacy-processed, replacing personal information with placeholders (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`).

## FAQ

### ***Why not directly use Shortcuts to write to CSV?***

While Shortcuts can directly write data to CSV files in iCloud, I chose to first input data into Numbers for several practical reasons:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Numbers provides a visual interface for reviewing and batch editing raw data, which raw CSV files cannot offer
2. **Manual Editing Flexibility**: Essential for real-world scenarios:
      - **`Cash payments`**: Shortcuts can only capture on-screen numbers, making manual entry necessary for cash transactions
      - **`Tip adjustments`**: Credit card screenshots capture pre-tip amounts, requiring manual updates to reflect actual totals
      - **`Rebates or reimbursements (checks)`**: Any rebates or reimbursements received as checks require manual entry, since these transactions are not captured by automated workflows

Numbers provides the reliability and flexibility that pure CSV automation cannot match.

### ***Why choose Google Looker Studio for visualization?***

I selected Google Looker Studio for the dashboard component for several key reasons:

1. **Google Ecosystem Integration**: Perfect integration with Google Sheets and Google Drive, eliminating data transfer complexity while providing excellent cloud-based user experience accessible from anywhere
2. **Cost-Effective**: Completely free to use, making it ideal for personal expense tracking projects
3. **Near Real-Time Updates**: Automatic data refresh capabilities that sync with Google Sheets changes (refreshes every 15 minutes)
